✅ Project Tracker – All Phases

Phase 1 – MVP
- Patient character with one body part to fix
- One problem object hidden in that body part (e.g., crayon)
- Patient gives initial visual + audio “problem” indicator
- Problem body part shows visual + audio hint until tapped
- Player taps to “fix” it
- Patient gives visual + audio “fixed” indicator
- Round ends after fix (or loops — TBD)
- Doctor’s office background for safe exposure
- Bilingual dialog audio indicator before other indicators (e.g., “Can you find the ear?” / “¿Puedes encontrar la oreja?”) — asset-dependent
- Free placeholder assets for art and sound in early build

Phase 2 – Multiple Body Parts
- Multiple selectable body parts per round
- Randomized problem placement per playthrough
- Expanded hint system for each part

Phase 3 – Tools Interaction
- Introduce basic tool(s) to “remove” the object
- Visual + audio feedback for tool usage
- Tool selection UI

Phase 4 – Customization & Rewards
- Dress-up/customization for patient character
- Simple reward animations or stickers after successful fixes
- Unlockable content over time

Phase 5 – Polish & Accessibility
- Replace placeholders with final art & audio assets
- Accessibility options (e.g., adjustable hint timing, text-to-speech)
- Smooth animations and transitions
