✅ Project Tracker – All Phases

Phase 1 – MVP
- Patient character with one body part to fix
- One problem Removable Object in that body part (e.g., crayon)
- Patient gives initial visual “problem” discomfort sprite indicator
- Player mouse clicks to “fix” it
- Patient gives visual joy sprite indicator + audio “fixed” indicator
- Patient gives visual indicator that everything is normal netural sprite
- Round ends after fix
- Doctor’s office background for safe exposure
- AI generated assets for art Patient and Removable Object

Phase 2 – Multiple Rounds Game loop
- Bilingual dialog audio indicator before other indicators (e.g., “Can you find the ear?” / “¿Puedes encontrar la oreja?”) — asset-dependent
- Examination container shows visual + audio hint until tapped
- Player taps to “fix” it
- Round loops after fix, new randomized problem object and body part appear in examination container per round
- Winning round — TBD
Gameplay Flow (Ideas for phase 2)

Start Prompt:
The patient shows subtle cues visual discomfort, brief bilingual voice line introduces the round indicating the discomfort in body part — e.g., “My ear hurts can you please check my ear? / Me duele la oreja, ¿puedes revisarmela por favor?”

Examination Phase:
After a short pause the players attention is drawn to the examination area - e.g. visual highlight examination area, highlight the problem object e.g. crayon and play brief problem sound.

Fixing Phase:
Loop highlights and sound in examination area until phase 1’s click interaction.

Resolution:
Patient reacts with joy and a brief success sound.

Transition:
The next round starts automatically after a short visual neutral moment, randomizing both body part and object.

Win Condition:
After a fixed number of successful rounds (e.g., 3–5), the player sees a “Great job, Doctor!” summary or simple mini-reward.

Phase 3 – Tools Interaction (Before we start this phase the game should have been exported to my daughters tablet)
- Introduce basic tool(s) to “remove” the object
- Visual + audio feedback for tool usage
- Tool selection UI

Phase 4 – Customization & Rewards
- Dress-up/customization for patient character
- Simple reward animations or stickers after successful fixes
- Unlockable content over time

Phase 5 – Polish & Accessibility
- Accessibility options (e.g., adjustable hint timing, text-to-speech)
- Smooth animations and transitions

GAME PLAY LOOP
At launch of game

Background (doctor office). 

Patient in discomfort expression. 

A visible cyan rectangle with ear + mouth sprite (This is a bug as expected for now until we discuss a game loop), indicating the body part.

An object crayon + lago (This is a bug as expected for now until we discuss a game loop) inside that body part container, ready for interaction.

The Exit button in the corner.

EarPainEnglish / EarPainSpanish – bilingual pain voice lines

*Current game play one time interaction ( until we have a game loop )

Patient shows joy and after short delay shows neutral expression.

Audio fixed sound to play depending on if the player has interacted with the removable object container.
