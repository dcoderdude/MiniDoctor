✅ Project Tracker – All Phases

Phase 1 – MVP
- Patient character with one body part to fix
- One problem Removable Object in that body part (e.g., crayon)
- Patient gives initial visual “problem” discomfort sprite indicator
- Player mouse clicks to “fix” it
- Patient gives visual joy sprite indicator + audio “fixed” indicator
- Patient gives visual indicator that everything is normal netural sprite
- Round ends after fix
- Doctor’s office background for safe exposure
- AI generated assets for art Patient and Removable Object

Phase 2 – Multiple Rounds Game loop
- Bilingual dialog audio indicator before other indicators (e.g., “Can you find the ear?” / “¿Puedes encontrar la oreja?”) — asset-dependent
- Examination container shows visual + audio hint until tapped
- Player taps to “fix” it
- Round loops after fix, new randomized problem object and body part appear in examination container per round
- Winning round — TBD

Phase 3 – Tools Interaction (Before we start this phase the game should have been exported to my daughters tablet)
- Introduce basic tool(s) to “remove” the object
- Visual + audio feedback for tool usage
- Tool selection UI

Phase 4 – Customization & Rewards
- Dress-up/customization for patient character
- Simple reward animations or stickers after successful fixes
- Unlockable content over time

Phase 5 – Polish & Accessibility
- Accessibility options (e.g., adjustable hint timing, text-to-speech)
- Smooth animations and transitions
