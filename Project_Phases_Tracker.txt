✅ Project Tracker – All Phases

Phase 1 – MVP
- Patient character with one body part to fix
- One problem Removable Object in that body part (e.g., crayon)
- Patient gives initial visual “problem” discomfort sprite indicator
- Player mouse clicks to “fix” it
- Patient gives visual joy sprite indicator + audio “fixed” indicator
- Patient gives visual indicator that everything is normal netural sprite
- Round ends after fix
- Doctor’s office background for safe exposure
- AI generated assets for art Patient and Removable Object

Phase 2 – Multiple Rounds Game loop
- Bilingual dialog audio indicator before other indicators (e.g., “Can you find the ear?” / “¿Puedes encontrar la oreja?”) — asset-dependent
- Examination container shows visual + audio hint until tapped
- Player taps to “fix” it
- Round loops after fix, new randomized problem object and body part appear in examination container per round
- Winning round — TBD
Gameplay Flow (Ideas for phase 2)

Phase 3 - In-game & Platform
- add logic inside the running game so that, after the first MiniDoctor experience finishes, the game can continue to another experience without having to press Godot’s Play Scene again.
- export the project from Godot so it can be launched on an Android tablet.

GAME PLAY LOOP
At launch of game

Background (doctor office). 

Patient in discomfort expression. 

A visible cyan rectangle with ear + mouth sprite (This is a bug as expected for now until we discuss a game loop), indicating the body part.

An object crayon + lago (This is a bug as expected for now until we discuss a game loop) inside that body part container, ready for interaction.

The Exit button in the corner.

EarPainEnglish / EarPainSpanish – bilingual pain voice lines

*Current game play one time interaction ( until we have a game loop )

Patient shows joy and after short delay shows neutral expression.

Audio fixed sound to play depending on if the player has interacted with the removable object container.

Start Prompt:
The patient shows subtle cues visual discomfort, brief bilingual voice line introduces the round indicating the discomfort in body part — e.g., “My ear hurts can you please check my ear? / Me duele la oreja, ¿puedes revisarmela por favor?”

Examination Phase:
After a short pause the players attention is drawn to the examination area - e.g. visual highlight examination area, highlight the problem object e.g. crayon and play brief problem sound.

Fixing Phase:
Loop highlights and sound in examination area until phase 1’s click interaction.

Resolution:
Patient reacts with joy and a brief success sound.
